Sword & Shield Animset Pro 1.1
--------------------------

This package contains a set of over 120 motion captured animations for characters armed with sword and shield. It also contains 2 sword fighting game templates with "drag and drop" Player and Enemies controllers, made in PlayMaker visual scripting plugin in Unity3d.

TPP Slasher and Sidescrolling Platformer


Works with Unity FREE and Pro.

You need PlayMaker for the controller to work.

If you don't want to use PlayMaker, you can still use all the animations to build your own controller. The animations do not require PlayMaker to work.

All animations are in FBX format, baked on Autodesk HIK skeleton, used in all Kubold's animation packages. They use Mecanim Humanoid Rig, but can be converted to Generic or Legacy rig.
