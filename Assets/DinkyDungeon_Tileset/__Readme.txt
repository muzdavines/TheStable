Stay updated and follow my thread on the unity forums:

INSTALLATION:

First, make sure you have the standard "Particles" and "Character Controllers" assets
loaded in your project. Than import the dinkydungeon.unitypackage

USAGE:

Always use the prefabs under "_Dungeon_Prefabs" to build your maze.

Set the background color of your camera to black. 

Drag the corridor or room tile into your scene and move it about 10 units
on your X and Z coordinates. Rotate it on Y axis in 90 degree steps, if needed.

To build and upper or lower level you need to move the tile(s) on the Y axis
for +2,79 or -2,79 and connect the levels with the stairs tile.

I recommend to first build the level on the "ground" with all assets you need.
Than create a empty game object (make sure all coords are on zero) and put your
entire level in it. Now you can easily set it to lower or upper coordinates. 


For a First Person view only you can turn off or delete the objects
with "_Topdown_solid_" in the name.

For a 3rd person vie only you can turn off or delete the objects with
"_Ceiling" in the name.


I think everthing else is self-explanatory.
Have fun with my tileset.
