Thanks for purchasing my Particle Scaler Tool!

If you havenÕt already, import the package into your Unity 3D project by double clicking the .unitypackage file, make sure all files are selected, and then click the 'import' button.

Using the Tool

To open the tool, select it from Window > Luke Peek > Particle Scaler Tool. The panel can be moved and docked just as any other panel.

To use, simply select the game objects you want to scale from within the Hierarchy. When you select a game object the controls within the tool will become available:

Scale Children:
Tick to scale all children within the selected game object. Deselect to scale just those that are selected.

Scale Position:
Scale the transform position of the game object at the same time.

Clear on Scale:
Clear any playing particles. Particularly useful when scaling particle systems with high-lifetime particles.

Preset Scales:
Select from a number of commonly used and easy to remember scales.

Custom Scale:
Scale the selected game objects to a custom scale. Drag the slider or type a float into the input box.

Selected Objects:
Shows the currently selected objects in the Hierarchy.


I hope you find the tool useful!
