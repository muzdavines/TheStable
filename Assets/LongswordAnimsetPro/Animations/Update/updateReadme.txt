This is 65 new animations for building a two-stance longsword combat system.

This means the character can now stand left or right foot forward, with the sword on the right or left side of the body. This is way more realistic for a lognsword than fighting just right foot forward.

Example:

The character has the sword on the right side of the body. He swings the sword from right to left. The swing animation finishes in a pose with the sword being on the left side of the body. With new animations you can now simply move the character and he will remain in that pose, until he swings the sword again from left to right. This creates a good flow of combat.

This is how it's supposed to work: https://youtu.be/4SgzsDThceM
