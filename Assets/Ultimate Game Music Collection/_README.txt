**** Thank you for purchasing Ultimate Game Music ****

My aim with this package has been always been to create a large library of music, diverse enough to be useful in any game project but affordable enough for developers of all kinds to use.

I hope that you find the music in this package useful and wish you the best of luck with whatever youâ€™re working on.

Thank you,
John.
